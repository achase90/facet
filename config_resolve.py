    An EXISTING destination keeps its own mode: stripping the group/other read

    ``frame.tokens`` and ``immich.api_key`` in plaintext. Creating it 0664 and

    the umask, so the create mode is named 0600 -- the same bits

      not to be the file that was lstat'ed. NOTHING was written, the destination
      is untouched, and the caller may still fall back to ``os.replace``.

    * **True -- committed.** Content, ownership, mode, inode and every hard link

    ``api.config._read_config`` arms ``config_load_failed()`` on it and

def atomic_write_json(path, data, new_file_mode=_SECRET_FILE_MODE):
    """Replace ``path`` with ``data``, durably, at its current mode and owner.

    Two commit routes, one signature. The payload is always staged in a temp
    file beside the destination, written and fsynced there first; what differs
    is how that content reaches the real name.

    **The replace route** -- ``chmod`` to :func:`_replacement_mode`, then
    ``os.replace`` -- is the default and is unchanged. It is atomic: a reader
    holds the whole old file or the whole new one, never a mix. It creates a NEW
    inode, so it preserves the destination's mode but its OWNER is whoever ran
    the process, and it replaces only this NAME (other hard links to the old
    inode keep pointing at the old content).

    **The in-place route** -- write, ``ftruncate``, ``fsync`` through the
    destination's own descriptor -- preserves the inode, and with it the owner,
    the group, the mode and every hard link. It is not atomic: for the duration
    of the write a concurrent reader can see a torn mix of the two configs, and
    a crash inside it leaves the config unparseable. That is a genuinely NEW
    failure mode, impossible while this function only ever renamed -- and the
    reason the staging copy is kept when it happens, see below.

    The choice between them is made on ownership alone, and only ever in the
    direction of preserving what is already there:

    1. If the destination is not a plain file the process can identify -- absent,
       a directory, a FIFO, a SYMLINK -- the replace route is taken. A symlink
       must be SUBSTITUTED rather than written through; that is what
       docker-entrypoint.sh and ``api.config_writes`` both promise about this
       function, and :func:`_destination_identity` is where it is decided.
    2. If the staged copy already has the destination's uid and gid -- the
       ordinary single-owner install -- the replace route is taken, with the
       same syscalls in the same order as before this route existed.
    3. Otherwise the staged copy is chowned to the destination's owner. Success
       means the replace route again, now landing correctly owned.
    4. A REFUSED chown (a rootless container: the operator owns the file, the
       process is a subuid without CAP_CHOWN) is what selects the in-place
       route, because a rename there would silently re-own the operator's config
       to a subuid they cannot chown back from inside the container.
    5. If even the in-place open is refused, the replace route runs anyway and
       :func:`_warn_ownership_not_preserved` says so. A write that succeeds
       today never starts failing because ownership could not be kept.
    6. The replace route also falls BACK to the in-place one when ``os.replace``
       fails with a name-level errno (``_REPLACE_DENIED_ERRNOS``) on a
       destination that exists -- a single-file Docker bind mount answers EBUSY.
       That case used to be reported to the operator as unfixable.

    The staging copy is removed on every path except one: an in-place write that
    RAISED after starting. There the destination may be torn and the temp is the
    only intact copy of the config, so it is kept deliberately, and
    :func:`staged_config_copies` is what lets ``api.config`` point the operator
    at it. Recovery is manual by design -- see that function.

    That is the shape of the new failure mode, and it is worth stating plainly
    because nothing like it could happen while every write was a rename: a
    process killed inside an in-place write leaves a config that does not parse,
    which ``api.config._read_config`` treats as ``config_load_failed()`` and
    ``api.auth`` then reads as an install to keep LOCKED rather than one with no
    passwords. The server still boots, every edition route refuses, and it stays
    that way until a human puts the staging copy over the config. Failing closed
    is the right end of that trade, and it is why the copy survives.

    Atomicity is per write, not per read-modify-write: every caller that reads
    scoring_config.json, edits part of it and writes it back MUST hold
    ``api.config.CONFIG_WRITE_LOCK`` -- which is NOT defined here, and cannot
    be: this module is stdlib-only so that ``db.connection`` and ``viewer`` can
    import it -- across the whole sequence, or one caller's update
    is lost wholesale under another's. That lock is the only one taken while a
    config write is in flight; ``api.config.reload_config`` may acquire it
    while holding that module's ``_config_lock``, so no writer may call
    ``reload_config`` without first releasing it. All three names live in
    ``api/config.py``; the ordering is stated here because this is the
    primitive they all end up calling.

    That lock is in-process, and the in-place route widens what a reader OUTSIDE
    it can see: a CLI or a second server parsing the config during an in-place
    write can read a torn mix and report a syntax error in a file that is fine a
    millisecond later. Under the replace route such a reader saw one whole
    version or the other. The exposure is bounded by a single ``os.write`` of a
    few kilobytes, and it is the price of not re-owning the operator's file; a
    reader that must never see a torn config should retry a parse failure once.

    The payload is serialized ONCE and both routes are handed the same string,
    so the two can never disagree about what was written. ``json.dumps``
    defaults to ``ensure_ascii=True``, which makes it pure ASCII -- that is what
    lets the staging copy go out through a text-mode file object and the
    in-place route through a utf-8 encode without the locale's default encoding
    getting a vote.

    Note the mode PRESERVATION still makes this the wrong primitive for a secret
    whose file may already exist too loosely -- see
    ``api.config._atomic_write_owner_only``, which forces 0600 unconditionally.
    ``new_file_mode`` only covers the case where there is no mode to preserve
    because the destination does not exist; it never touches an existing file.

    The scratch file is named after :data:`_TEMP_CONFIG_PREFIX` rather than
    left to mkstemp's default, so neither a crash before the commit nor a torn
    in-place write leaves a stageable name behind: the staging copy is the whole
    config, password hashes included.
